## README for the BucketList Application using MEAN Stack

This is a simple bucket list application that lets you create, view and delete your bucketlist items. This is an example to demostrate setting up a project using MEAN stack. 

You need node, mongodb and angular-cli to use this project. To install, run

```
npm install
```

The angular front-end code is located inside the `angular-src`. 

Do a `npm install` inside the `angular-src` directory so that npm can install all the angular dependencies

Angular-CLI's

```
ng build
```

should compile the static code into the root `public` directory.

Run `npm start` to get this started!
